Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu) at the University of Washington. My research interests include the design and analysis of clinical trials, and applying statistical methods and data science tools to improve population health.

<hr/>

I am co-advised by [Dr. Ting Ye](https://sites.google.com/view/tingye) and [Dr. Noah Simon](http://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/). Our research focuses on developing robust and flexible statistical methods for clinical trials that have adaptive elements, like [group sequential trials](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.70082), [trials that use covariate-adaptive randomization](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/biomet/asaf029/8112010?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false), and platform trials.

*Our package [RobinCar](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RobinCar/index.html) for covariate adjustment in randomized clinical trials -- and its sister package [RobinCar2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RobinCar2/index.html) -- are now available on CRAN!*

I am also a Research Assistant with [Dr. Fei Gao](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/gao-fei.html) in the [Biostatistics, Bioinformatics, and Epidemiology Program](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division/research/biostatistics-bioinformatics-and-epidemiology.html) at [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center](http://www.fhcrc.org). We are working on statistical methods for estimating cross-sectional HIV incidence, which are useful for population effectiveness studies, and for obtaining counterfactual placebo incidence in active-controlled trials (see our recent papers in Statistics in Medicine [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.9296) and [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.10112)). We also have recent work discussing study designs of retrospective, observational studies of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Previously I was a Post-Bachelor Fellow and a Researcher on the Mathematical Sciences team at IHME where I worked on a variety of disease modeling projects for the [Global Burden of Disease Study](http://www.healthdata.org/gbd). I also helped train GBD collaborators from around the world and new Fellows in computing, and statistical and epidemiological methods. During my fellowship, I obtained my MS in Biostatistics, advised by [Dr. Ruth Etzioni](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/etzioni-ruth.html) on methods to estimate time to cancer progression or recurrence.
